## Who am I

My name is Ivan Pozdniakov. I teach data analysis and statistics in R, both as courses at universities and as a tutor. I have a free book (in Russian) ["Data Analysis and Statistics in R"](https://pozdniakov.github.io/tidy_stats/). I currently live in Tbilisi, Georgia, where I left after Putin started a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

## Plans and interests

I am in the process of returning to science after working in IT and teaching. My main area of interest is computational neuroscience and [I am looking for a PhD position in this field.]{.underline}

My other academic interests include philosophy of mind and digital humanities. I have collaborated with the DraCor team for years, in particular, I've developed a CRAN-published R package `{rdracor}` and the [Shiny web application](https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-shiny). I am also interested in history, politics, philosophy (the hard problem of consciousness especially), activism, data journalism, data science, generative art, R and tidyverse. If you are interested in collaboration, e-mail me at `ivanspozdniakov@gmail.com`
