My name is Ivan Pozdniakov I teach data analysis and statistics in R, both as courses at universities and as a tutor. I have a free book (in Russian) ["Data Analysis and Statistics in R"](https://pozdniakov.github.io/tidy_stats/). I currently live in Tbilisi, Georgia, where I left after Putin's invasion of Ukraine started.

I am in the process of returning to science after working in IT and teaching. My main area of interest is computational neuroscience and I am looking for a PhD position in this field.

My other academic interests include philosophy of mind and digital humanities. I have collaborated with the DraCor team for years, in particular I developed the CRAN published R package `{rdracor}` and the [Shiny web application](https://github.com/dracor-org/dracor-shiny). I am also interested in history, politics, philosophy (especially the hard problem of consciousness), activism, data journalism, data science, generative art, R and tidyverse.
